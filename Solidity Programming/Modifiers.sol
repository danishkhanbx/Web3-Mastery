/* Modifier:
1. A modifier is a special type of function that you use to modify the behavior of other functions. 
2. Modifiers allow you to add extra conditions or functionality to a function without having to rewrite the entire function.
3. The _; symbol is a special symbol that is used in Solidity modifiers to indicate the end of the modifier and the beginning of the function that the modifier is modifying.
4. Without the _; symbol, the compiler would not know where to insert the code from the modifier into the function.
